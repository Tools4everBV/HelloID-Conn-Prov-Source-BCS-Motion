## Introduction

_HelloID-Conn-Prov-Source-BCS-Motion (previous _Centric-Motion_) is a _source_ connector. The purpose of this connector is to import _persons_ and their _contracts_. The connector imports a set of CSV files that are generated by BCS and then transferred via SFTP to a fileserver on the local network. An agent server is required for this connector to work.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- HelloID Provisioning agent (on-prem).
- Scheduled exports of person and contract data in CSV format from Motion.
  - The customer informs BCS that they want to integrate with Motion. BCS then knows which queries to use for this connector.
  - BCS schedules these queries and exports the results to the customer's cloud environment. The location where this is placed must be accessible via SFTP.
  - The customer ensures that these files are copied daily from the cloud location via SFTP to a file server accessible to HelloID.

### Connection settings

As this connector is created for one implementation, it's possible these settings have to be changed.

| Setting         | Description                                   | Mandatory   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Moyion CSV File Location         | The full path to the CSV files to import | Yes         |
| CSV Delimiter          | CSV Delimiter | Yes         |

## Remarks

- Preparation by BCS is required.
- An SFTP connection to BCS has to be setup by the customer and a script needs to be created to download the data from BCS.
- A local agent is required for this connector to run.

### Mappings

A mapping export is provided. Make sure to further customize these accordingly.
